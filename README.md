# Open Data Product Specification Online Events 

## Purpose of ODPS Live

ODPS Live is a monthly webinar series designed to grow and support the global Open Data Product Specification (ODPS) community. Each session highlights a different aspect of building, adopting, or evolving ODPS—from real-world use cases and tooling deep dives to roadmap insights and inspiring stories.

The purpose of these events is to:
- Share knowledge and best practices from across the ODPS ecosystem
- Foster collaboration between adopters, contributors, and partners
- Provide a platform for innovation around open, interoperable data products
- Keep the community informed on the evolution and impact of the ODPS standard

Whether you're a seasoned contributor or new to the data product space, ODPS Live helps you stay connected, inspired, and equipped to lead with open standards.
