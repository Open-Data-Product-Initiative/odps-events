# Open Data Product Specification Online Events 

## Purpose



## Theme Category Descriptions

- **Use Case**  
  Real-world examples of how organizations apply the Open Data Product Specification (ODPS) in practice. These sessions highlight adoption journeys, outcomes, and lessons learned from implementing ODPS in different domains.

- **Tooling**  
  Deep dives into tools, frameworks, and workflows that support ODPS implementation. Sessions may include live demos, integrations (e.g., GitHub, CI/CD, data catalogs), and tips for automation or developer enablement.

- **Roadmap**  
  Updates and previews from the ODPS core team on whatâ€™s coming next. Covers standard evolution, new features (e.g., licensing, agents, compliance), and opportunities for community involvement.

- **Inspiration**  
  Broader stories that inspire innovation and leadership in the data product space. Could be founder journeys, paradigm shifts (e.g., product vs. project), or big-picture conversations around open ecosystems and the future of data.

- **Workshop / Panel**  
  Interactive or multi-speaker formats. Workshops focus on hands-on learning (e.g., writing specs), while panels bring together different voices from the ecosystem to explore timely or controversial topics.
